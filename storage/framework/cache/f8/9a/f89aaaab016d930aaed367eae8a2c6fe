    <ol>
      <li>
        Configure once, use it anyware the way it was configured in the service provider.
      </li>
      <li>
        Imagine you have created a class which requires multiple dependencies and in general you use it like this:
        <pre>
          <code>
            $foo = new Foo( new Bar(config('someSecretKey')),
                            new Baz(new Moo(), new Boo()),
                            new Woo('yolo', 5)
                          );
          </code>
        </pre>
        Its doable but you wouldn't want to figure out these dependencies everytime you try to initiate this class.  Thats why you want to use <code>Service Provider</code> where in the <code>register</code> method you can define this class as:
        <pre>
          <code>
            $this->app->singleton('My\Awesone\Foo',
                                  function($app)
                                  {
                                    return new Foo(new Bar(config('someSecretKey')),
                                                   new Baz(new Moo(), new Boo()),
                                                   new Woo('yolo', 5)
                                                  );
                                  }
                                 );
          </code>
        </pre>
        But using the <code>Service Provider</code>, if you need to use this class, you can just type hint it in the controller (<code>Service Container</code> will figure it out) or ask for it manually like
        <code>$foo = app('My\Awesome\Foo::class');</code> <br>
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>"...Encapsulating the logic of creating a specific class + binding + IOC = following PSR"</strong>
        <pre class="preOverride1">
        The beauty of this approach is the fact that, once you create your <code>Service Provider</code>(which encapsulates logic of creating a specific class + binding it into the 
        <code>IOC container</code> =&gt; following PSR, if you are into that stuff) or use <code>AppServiceProvider</code>, if you need just a simple binding, you are done with it 
        most of the time.  You dont't need to worry anywhere in the application about the dependencies of your Foo Class and if those dependencies eventually change, then you 
        make the edit in one place --- the <code>Service Provider</code>, and the rest of the application remains unchanged, since automatic resolution is used elsewhere.
        The service provider is a convinient place to put this sort of logic (class dependencies configuration/ class configs, then binding to the <code>Service Container or IOC</code>).  
        Ignoring the service container and one might have to do a rework when catering to singleton approaches, provide different concret classes when requesting an implementation 
        of a particular interface, your class will have to handle a lot and grow big enough to have an equivalent of the <code>ICO or service container</code> version 1.0.
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>"...Configures and initializes objects for later use."</strong>
        <pre class="preOverride1">
        Basically, a <code>service provider</code> has no functionality : it configures/initializes things.  For example, you have an interface with many concrete implementations 
        and want to bind that interface to a particular concrete class so it can be injected elsewhere.
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>"...Configure only once; there is no need to search/replace all instances of concrete classes that you may have used."</strong>
        <pre class="preOverride1">
        <strong>Service Provider</strong> tells the application which <strong>concrete class</strong> to instantiate/inject given an interface.  This way, whatever implementation
        you decide to use, its just a matter of changing the registration in the <strong>IOC container/service container</strong> and your applications just works, theres no need
        to search / replace all instances of concrete class that you may have used.
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <pre>
          <strong>Service Providers</strong> are not just here for binding things, you can also associate views to views composer, setup custom validators add another file system driver etc.
          Its like a bootstrap class for your application.
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>"...Define the dependencies in one place, change the dependencies in one place."</strong>
        <pre>
          You would define those dependencies only once, in the <strong>service provider</strong>.  Think of the <strong>service provider</strong> as a box that you define all your 
          dependencies in.  And in your application, instead of creating a whole new box, each time, you would just reference the existing <strong>service provider</strong> which
          resolves all your dependencies. The dependencies might look like this:
          <code>
            $var = new MyCoolClass( new Baz(),
                                    new Foo( new SubFoo() ),
                                    new Something()
                                  );
          </code>
          
          If you need this resolved somewhere in your application, you will have to write it each and everytime, 
          instead of just retrieving a service that resolves everything  for you.  In the future, if you need 
          to change anything, you make the change in one place.

          <pre class="preOverride1">
            So why bother making a <strong>contract</strong>?  Well, one of the amazing features in laravel is that you can <strong>type hint</strong> the contract, and the <strong>service provider</strong> 
            will return an instance of whatever concreate class you have bount to it.  This creates an incredibly flexible and loosely coupled structure becuase you will be able 
            to easily swap out implementations with a single line of code.

        But using the <code>Service Provider</code>, if you need to use this class, you can just type hint it in the controller (<code>Service Container</code> will figure it out) or ask for it manually like
        <code>$foo = app('My\Awesome\Foo::class');</code> <br>

         <strong>"...Encapsulating the logic of creating a specific class + binding + IOC = following PSR"</strong>
        <pre class="preOverride1">
        The beauty of this approach is the fact that, once you create your <code>Service Provider</code>(which encapsulates logic of creating a specific class + binding it into the 
        <code>IOC container</code> =&gt; following PSR, if you are into that stuff) or use <code>AppServiceProvider</code>, if you need just a simple binding, you are done with it 
        most of the time.  You dont't need to worry anywhere in the application about the dependencies of your Foo Class and if those dependencies eventually change, then you 
        make the edit in one place --- the <code>Service Provider</code>, and the rest of the application remains unchanged, since automatic resolution is used elsewhere.
        The service provider is a convinient place to put this sort of logic (class dependencies configuration/ class configs, then binding to the <code>Service Container or IOC</code>).  
        Ignoring the service container and one might have to do a rework when catering to singleton approaches, provide different concret classes when requesting an implementation 
        of a particular interface, your class will have to handle a lot and grow big enough to have an equivalent of the <code>ICO or service container</code> version 1.0.
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>"...Configures and initializes objects for later use."</strong>
        <pre class="preOverride1">
        Basically, a <code>service provider</code> has no functionality : it configures/initializes things.  For example, you have an interface with many concrete implementations 
        and want to bind that interface to a particular concrete class so it can be injected elsewhere.
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>"...Configure only once; there is no need to search/replace all instances of concrete classes that you may have used."</strong>
        <pre class="preOverride1">
        <strong>Service Provider</strong> tells the application which <strong>concrete class</strong> to instantiate/inject given an interface.  This way, whatever implementation
        you decide to use, its just a matter of changing the registration in the <strong>IOC container/service container</strong> and your applications just works, theres no need
        to search / replace all instances of concrete class that you may have used.
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <pre>
          <strong>Service Providers</strong> are not just here for binding things, you can also associate views to views composer, setup custom validators add another file system driver etc.
          Its like a bootstrap class for your application.
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>"...Define the dependencies in one place, change the dependencies in one place."</strong>
        <pre>
          You would define those dependencies only once, in the <strong>service provider</strong>.  Think of the <strong>service provider</strong> as a box that you define all your 
          dependencies in.  And in your application, instead of creating a whole new box, each time, you would just reference the existing <strong>service provider</strong> which
          resolves all your dependencies. The dependencies might look like this:
          <code>
            $var = new MyCoolClass( new Baz(),
                                    new Foo( new SubFoo() ),
                                    new Something()
                                  );
          </code>
          
          If you need this resolved somewhere in your application, you will have to write it each and everytime, 
          instead of just retrieving a service that resolves everything  for you.  In the future, if you need 
          to change anything, you make the change in one place.

          <pre class="preOverride1">
            So why bother making a <strong>contract</strong>?  Well, one of the amazing features in laravel is that you can <strong>type hint</strong> the contract, and the <strong>service provider</strong> 
            will return an instance of whatever concreate class you have bount to it.  This creates an incredibly flexible and loosely coupled structure becuase you will be able 
            to easily swap out implementations with a single line of code.
